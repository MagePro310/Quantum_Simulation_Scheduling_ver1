## Introduction

The **Quantum Simulation Scheduling** tool is designed to help researchers and developers simulate and schedule quantum operations efficiently. This simulator supports customizable configurations and provides insights into quantum system behavior.

---

## Installation

To install the simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Quantum_Simulation_Scheduling.git
    cd Quantum_Simulation_Scheduling
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Verify the installation:
    ```bash
    python simulator.py --help
    ```

---

## Getting Started

1. Import the simulator into your Python project:
    ```python
    from quantum_simulator import QuantumSimulator
    ```

2. Initialize the simulator:
    ```python
    simulator = QuantumSimulator(config="default_config.json")
    ```

3. Define your quantum operations and schedule them:
    ```python
    simulator.add_operation("H", qubit=0)
    simulator.add_operation("CNOT", control=0, target=1)
    simulator.run()
    ```

---

## Key Features

- **Customizable Scheduling**: Define and optimize quantum operation schedules.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate circuit diagrams and execution timelines.
- **Error Simulation**: Model noise and errors in quantum operations.
- **Scalability**: Simulate systems with multiple qubits.

---

## Running a Simulation

1. Prepare your configuration file (e.g., `config.json`).
2. Run the simulator:
    ```bash
    python simulator.py --config config.json
    ```
3. View the results in the output directory.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Circuit
```python
from quantum_simulator import QuantumSimulator

simulator = QuantumSimulator()
simulator.add_operation("X", qubit=0)
simulator.add_operation("H", qubit=1)
simulator.run()
```

### Example 2: Custom Schedule
```python
simulator.schedule_operations([
     {"gate": "H", "qubit": 0, "time": 0},
     {"gate": "CNOT", "control": 0, "target": 1, "time": 1}
])
simulator.run()
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Simulator crashes on startup.
  - **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the configuration file is valid.

- **Issue**: Incorrect simulation results.
  - **Solution**: Double-check your quantum operations and scheduling logic.
